## Part 1: Mailing List Conduct & Policies

### Commercial Announcements & Items For Sale

Commercial advertising from software, hardware, or service companies must be approved by the list administrators before being posted to the list. For approval, please contact:

<a href="mailto:newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net">newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net</a>

Personal messages advertising items wanted or for sale are permitted, providing you are selling Newton devices, accessories, software, or related services. Please refrain from advertising Macs, PCs, furniture, livestock, or other non-Newton items.

To provide a clear indication that a message has an advertising or transactional nature, please tag the subject line appropriately using the following prefixes:

* [WTB] — Wanted To Buy (looking to purchase something)
* [FS] — For Sale (private sale on the list, *not* an auction)
* [FA] — For Auction (auction on eBay or similar site)
* [FT] — For Trade (will trade goods for Newton or vice-versa)

When replying to transactional or other advertising messages, do *not* reply to the list. Reply directly to the author of the original message.

### Virus Warnings

Do *not* post virus warnings to the list. This is simply not appropriate mailing list behaviour. Historically, many virus warning are hoaxes. The best resource for information regarding internet hoaxes, urban legends, and the like is Snopes:

<a href="http://www.snopes.com/">snopes.com</a>

Even if it’s not a hoax, do *not* post virus warnings to the list.

### Anti-spam Software

If you use challenge and response anti-spam software, you must have the ability to white-list either:

All mail from our server:

continuity.cx

Or all mail with the following in the ‘To:’ field:

<a href="mailto:newtontalk@newtontalk.net">newtontalk@newtontalk.net</a>

If your anti-spam software sends messages directly to people who post to the list, you will be removed from the list until you remedy the problem.

If you receive an automated-reply from a mail-interception service in response to a message that you posted to the list, do *not* complain on the list. Forward the entire message to:

<a href="mailto:newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net">newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net</a>

The list administrators will attempt remedy the situation.

### Off-topic Posts

Off-topic posts and threads are generally tolerated if they were spawned from an on-topic thread. This is a different policy from many other mailing lists which have established separate lists for off-topic subjects, but here at NewtonTalk we maintain a more casual atmosphere.

However, threads which stray into heated topics such as politics, personal beliefs, morality, PC vs. Mac discussions, and the like should not exist on the list. Please take these topics to a more appropriate forum (like Usenet or your local tavern).

Please tag any off-topic posts with an [OT] prefix in the subject line. This makes it easier for other list members who may not want to read these post to filter them out.

### Polls & Surveys

Please do not post polls or survey questions to the list. If you have an idea for an interesting topic involving a poll or survey, please contact:

<a href="mailto:newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net">newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net</a>

There are many services available that provide the means to easily create free online polls and surveys. For example:

<a href="http://www.polldaddy.com/">polldaddy.com</a>
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">surveymonkey.com</a>

### Quoting Limits

The list software enforces rules for the maximum number of lines in any list message that it quoted from another message. If a message is over 50 lines total length, then the message must not be more than 70% quoted lines. If a message breaks this rule it will NOT be posted to the list; instead, the sender will receive a notification and be asked to revise and re-send their message.

### Message Archiving

Messages posted to NTLK are automatically included in two list archives:

<a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/">newtontalk.net/archive/</a><br />
<a href="http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk">marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk</a>

Once a message is posted, it cannot be removed from the archive, either on www.newtontalk.net or MARC. NewtonTalk informally follows MARC’s policy on privacy, which you can read at:

<a href="http://marc.10east.com/?q=about#Privacy">marc.10east.com/?q=about#Privacy</a>

### RSS Feed

The subject and first 100 lines of the latest 10 posts to the list are also available via an RSS 2.0 feed here:

<a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/newtontalk.rss">newtontalk.net/newtontalk.rss</a>

Each entry in the RSS feed contains a link to the full message in the archive.

### Message formats and attachments

The list software automatically strips away attached files and HTML from messages. Everything is plain text for maximum compatibility with all mail software.

### Other

E-mail addresses which encounter errors for more than 30 days will be removed from the list.

## Part 2: Mailing List Etiquette

In general, the best place to go to read about netiquette is RFC 1855:

<a href="http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html">www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html</a>

Many large parts of this have been borrowed from the Mailing List Etiquette FAQ:

<a href="http://www.gweep.ca/~edmonds/usenet/ml-etiquette.html">www.gweep.ca/~edmonds/usenet/ml-etiquette.html</a>

### How should I post or reply to messages from the list?

In short, courteously, properly, concisely, and to the right address:

<a href="mailto:newtontalk@newtontalk.net">newtontalk@newtontalk.net</a>

When replying to messages you receive from the list, you should acquaint yourself with the reply options of your mail reader. Most mail programs will have at least two reply modes: private and group. A private reply will go only to the person who sent the original message. A group reply by default should go to the original author, the list, and to any people who received private copies of the original message. You should be able to edit this list of addresses to reduce it to just the list address, plus any other people you think should receive private copies.

When quoting, be very careful to edit the quoted sections down to the bare minimum of text needed to maintain the context for your reply. There is very little on a mailing list that is more annoying than paging through a few pages of quoted text only to read a few lines at the end. Also be careful that you clearly indicate what text you’re quoting (as opposed to what you’re writing), and if possible, cite the author of the original text. If your mail program wants to attach the whole message you’re replying to on the end of your replies, please do not let it do this if you can possibly avoid it.

When creating a new topic, please start with a new message in your email software by using the “Compose”, “New Message”, or similar command. Do not simply “Reply” to an existing list message and replace the subject and body. When you use “Reply”, your email software ensures that your new message is included in the existing thread of the original topic. This causes confusion for people who rely on “threading” or “messsage grouping” in their email software and in the list archives.

<a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk.2004-03/1905.html">newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk.2004-03/1905.html</a>

### Is there anything I should not post to the list?

You should not post subscribe or unsubscribe requests to the list.

The basic rule is that as long as your post has some content related to the primary subject of the list, and does not contain much off-topic material, then it is fine for the list. Specifically, for almost every list, this will immediately rule out many or all commercial ads, postings on how to make money (such as MAKE MONEY FAST), sociology surveys, help with homework, hot international news, and requests for people to send birthday greetings to your friend.

Also, you should not post inflammatory (aka flame) mail to the list. It is perfectly fine to disagree with people publicly, but be careful how you do it. For example, if you think someone is lying on a subject, it may be fine to say “Betty’s claims about Wilma’s hair stylist are a lie,” but it is over the line to say “Betty is a liar”.

If someone posts something with which you are in particular agreement, that’s great. You should not, however, follow up to the list with a post containing no more than “Me too!” or “Right on, brother!” If you have something of substance to add to the discussion, then by all means do so, but if you simply wish to express a simple agreement, then do it in private mail.

## Part 3: Mailing List Operations

### How often is the digest sent?

The digest is sent whenever its size reaches 50K, or every 12 hours, if the first condition isn’t reached.

### How do I subscribe to the list?

### How do I unsubscribe from the list?

### How do I receive the digest instead of individual messages?

### How do I receive individual messages instead of the digest?

### How do I find out what my current status is?

Use the handy, dandy web interface:

<a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/">newtontalk.net</a>

### How do I set vacation mode?

### How do I get out of vacation mode?

Send a message from your subscribed address to <a href="mailto:ecartis@newtontalk.net">ecartis@newtontalk.net</a> with the string “set vacation” (without quotes) in the subject line. You can leave the body of the message blank. To unset, change the word “set” above to “unset”.

### I tried to post this a file to the list and it didn’t show up. What gives?

The list software automatically strips away attached files and HTML from messages. Everything is plain text for maximum compatibility with all mail software.

### I don’t want any more spam!

### Remove all of my messages from the archive!

### Someone said something nasty about me, remove it from the list!

NewtonTalk is an open, public communications medium. All posts to the list are publicly archived in two places:

On the NTLK website:

<a href="http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/">newtontalk.net/archive/</a>

On the searchable MARC archive:

<a href="http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk">marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk</a>

Once a message is posted to the list, it cannot and will not be removed from any of the archives. For one, this would be altering the public record of what happened on the list, and we wish to preserve this for as long as we can. Also, MARC will only remove messages if ordered to do so by an appropriate court order (threatening e-mails from lawyers will not get their attention).

## Part 4: General Information & History

### What is the NewtonTalk list?

NewtonTalk is a mailing list run by the Newton community, dedicated to discussion of the Newton line of handheld computers and related products. (We do go off-topic occasionally, though).

### Who in charge around here?

The list is currently managed by Grant Hutchinson. Unix twiddling and mailing list administration are not necessarily within his primary comfort zone. With that in mind, please keep him in your prayers.

The list server and web site are graciously hosted by Bill Shamam and the fine worker bees at Continuity.cx. The spartan, but functional web interface was written by the indubitable Paul Guyot.

List dad emeritus is Victor Rehorst.

### What software does the list run?

Newtontalk runs on 100% free software! We use the eCartis mailing list manager coupled with the Postfix mail delivery agent to transmit our pirate signal into The Matri… uh, send our messages out :)

### What happened to Planet Newton running the list?

We executed a coup.

### What the heck does that mean?

Okay, here’s the history:

Before June 1999, the list was run by one guy, Sean O’Shaughnessy, aka the “list dad.” Things were happy and carefree, and the Newton had just been cancelled, so no one was too worried :)

However, in 1999 Sean could no longer host the list on his own, and so asked for someone to pick it up. A web site called Planet Newton stepped in and agreed to take over the list from Sean.

Things were all right for a while, but in 2000 the list stared having problems: outages, duplicate messages, people being randomly unsubscribed, dropped digest subscribers, and the like. Sometimes this issues were fixed, but many people became frustrated at Planet Newton’s attitude towards management of the list. It was if they just didn’t care.

Two “emergency” lists were started in case PN went down.

During this time, many people asked Planet Newton if they would consider giving up the list, since they were obviously having problems managing it. All request (as far as the author knows) were met with denials.

In May 2001, PlanetNewton.com experienced a total server failure. Their website and the mailing list suddenly disappeared. An effort to replace PN’s list with a community-run server had already been in the works for several months, though. On June 12, 2001, NewtonTalk.net was launched.

Victor Rehorst and Paul Guyot were co-adminstrators of the list from the transition to NewtonTalk.net until early 2007. Grant Hutchinson took over list administration duties in March 2007.
