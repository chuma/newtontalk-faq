PART 1: LIST CONDUCT AND POLICIES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

i. Commercial and For-Sale announcements

  Commercial ads from companies must be approved before being posted
  to the list.  For approval, please contact newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net

  Personal buy/sell messages are OK, as long as you are selling NEWTONS, 
  EMATES, or related accessories or software / services.  Not Macs, PCs, 
  furniture, or anything else.  We ask that you tag your subject line
  appropriately depending on the type of message:

  - [WTB] - Wanted To Buy (looking for some merchandies)
  - [FS] - For Sale (private sale on the list, NOT AN AUCTION)
  - [FA] - For Auction (auction on eBay)
  - [FT] - For Trade (trade XXX goods for Newton or vice-versa)

  Replies to for-sale messages should NOT be sent to the list.

ii. Virus Warnings

  Please do NOT post virus warnings to the list.  This is not appropriate!
  Many of these are hoaxes.  The best website to visit to find out about
  hoaxes, urban legends, and the like is Snopes:

  http://www.snopes.com/

  Even if it's not a hoax, DON'T POST VIRUS WARNINGS TO THE LIST.

iii. Anti-spam software

  if you use a challenge/response type of anti-spam software, you must 
  have the ability to white-list all mail from our server 
  (mail.continuity.cx) or all mail with the To: field set to 
  "newtontalk@newtontalk.net".  If your anti-spam software sends messages 
  directly to people who post to the list, you will be removed from the 
  list until you remedy the problem.

  If you happen to receive an automated-reply or a response from a
  mail-intercept service in response to a message that you posted to the
  list, DON'T complain on the list.  Please forward the message the message to
  newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net so that we can remedy the situation.

iv. Off-topic topics

  Off-topic posts and threads are generally tolerated if they were spawned
  from an on-topic thread.  This is a different policy from many other 
  mailing lists which have established separate lists for off-topic subjects,
  but here at NTLK we maintain a more casual atmosphere.

  However, threads which stray into heated topics such as politics, personal
  beliefs, morality, PC vs. Mac discussions and the like should not exist on
  the list.  Please take these topics to a more appropriate forum (like Usenet).

  Please tag any off-topic posts with [OT] in the subject line, so that people
  who do not want to read them can easily filter them out.

v. Poll-type topics

  Please do not post poll-type questions to the list.  If you have an idea
  for an interesting poll topic, please e-mail newtontalk-admins@newtontalk.net
  and we will setup a poll on the newtontalk.net webpage and announce it to
  the list.

vi. Quoting Limits

  The list software enforces rules for the maximum number of lines in any
  list message that it quoted from another message.  If a message is over
  50 lines total length, then the message must not be more than 70% quoted
  lines.  If a message breaks this rule it will NOT be posted to the list;
  instead, the sender will recieve a notification and be asked to revise
  and re-send their message.

vii. Message Archiving

  Messages posted to NTLK are automatically included in two list archives:
  http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/
  and
  http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk

  Once a message is posted, it cannot be removed from the archive, either 
  on www.newtontalk.net or MARC.  NewtonTalk informally follows MARC's 
  policy on privacy, which you can read at:
  http://marc.10east.com/?q=about#Privacy

viii. RSS Feed

  The subject and first 100 lines of the latest 10 posts to the list are
  also available via an RSS 2.0 feed here:
  http://www.newtontalk.net/newtontalk.rss

  Each entry in the RSS feed contains a link to the full message in the archive.

ix. Message formats and attachments

  The list software automatically strips away attached files and HTML from 
  messages.  Everything is plain text for maximum compatibility with all 
  mail software.

x. Other

  E-mail addresses which encounter errors for more than 30 days will be 
  removed from the list.

PART 2: LIST ETIQUETTE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, the best place to go to read about netiquette is RFC 1855:
http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html

Many large parts of this have been borrowed from the Mailing List 
Etiquette FAQ: http://www.gweep.ca/~edmonds/usenet/ml-etiquette.html

How should I post to/reply to messages from the list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In short, courteously, properly, concisely, and to the right address: 
newtontalk@newtontalk.net

When replying to messages you receive from the list, you should acquaint 
yourself with the reply options of your mail reader. Most mail programs 
will have at least two reply modes: private and group. A private reply 
will go only to the person who sent the original message. A group reply by 
default should go to the original author, the list, and to any people who 
received private copies of the original message. You should be able to 
edit this list of addresses to reduce it to just the list address, plus 
any other people you think should receive private copies. 

when quoting, be very careful to edit the quoted sections down to the bare
minimum of text needed to maintain the context for your reply. There is
very little on a mailing list that is more annoying than paging through a
few pages of quoted text only to read a few lines at the end. Also be
careful that you clearly indicate what text you're quoting (as opposed to
what you're writing), and if possible, cite the author of the original
text.  If your mail program wants to attach the whole message you're
replying to on the end of your replies, please do not let it do this if
you can possibly avoid it.

When you are creating a new message topic, please start with a fresh,
clean message in your mail reader by using the "Compose" or "New Message"
button, instead of hitting "Reply" to a list message and replacing the
subject and body.  The reason is, when you hit "Reply" your mail reader
will ensure that your message is included in the thread of the other topic,
and for people who rely on threading this causes confusion.  For more
information see:

http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/newtontalk.2004-03/1905.html

Is there anything I should not post to the list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should not post subscribe or unsubscribe requests to the list.

The basic rule is that as long as your post has some content related to 
the primary subject of the list, and does not contain much off-topic 
material, then it is fine for the list. Specifically, for almost every 
list, this will immediately rule out many or all commercial ads, postings 
on how to make money (such as MAKE MONEY FAST), sociology surveys, help 
with homework, hot international news, and requests for people to send 
birthday greetings to your friend.

Also, you should not post inflammatory (aka flame) mail to the list. It is 
perfectly fine to disagree with people publicly, but be careful how you do 
it. For example, if you think someone is lying on a subject, it may be 
fine to say ``Betty's claims about Wilma's hair stylist are a lie,'' but 
it is over the line to say ``Betty is a liar''. 

If someone posts something with which you are in particular agreement, 
that's great. You should not, however, follow up to the list with a post 
containing no more than ``Me too!'' or ``Right on, brother!'' If you have 
something of substance to add to the discussion, then by all means do so, 
but if you simply wish to express a simple agreement, then do it in 
private mail.

PART 3: GENERAL LIST INFO AND HISTORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is the NewtonTalk list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NewtonTalk is a mailing list run by the Newton community, dedicated to
discussion of the Newton line of handheld computers and related products.
(We do go off-topic occasionally, though).


Who runs the list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list itself is currently managed by Victor Rehorst.  The list server
is hosted by Bill Shamam and continuity.cx.  The web interface was written
by Paul Guyot.  The assistant list admins are Paul Guyot and Grant Hutchinson.


What software does the list run?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newtontalk runs on 100% free software!  We use the eCartis mailing list
manager coupled with the Postfix mail delivery agent to transmit our pirate
signal into The Matri.... uh, send our messages out :)


What happened to Planet Newton running the list?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have executed a coup.


What the heck does that mean??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Okay, here's the history:

Before June 1999, the list was run by one guy, Sean O'Shaughnessy, aka the 
"list dad."  Things were happy and carefree, and the Newton had just been 
cancelled, so no one was too worried :)

However, in 1999 Sean could no longer host the list on his own, and so 
asked for someone to pick it up.  PlanetNewton.com stepped in and agreed 
to take over the list for Sean.

Things were alright for a while, but sometime in 2000 the list had
problems: outages, duplicate messages, people being randomly unsubscribed,
dropped digest subscribers and the like.  Sometimes they were fixed, but
many people became frustrated at PN's attitude towards the list
management.  Many felt that they just didn't care.  Two "emergency" lists 
were started in case PN went down.

During this time, many people asked Planet Newton if they would consider 
giving up the list, since they were obviously having problems managing it.  
All request (as far as the author knows) were met with denials.

In May 2001, PlanetNewton.com experienced a total server failure.  Their 
website and the mailing list suddenly disappeared.  An effort to replace 
PN's list with a community-run server had already been in the works for 
several months, though.  On June 12, 2001, NewtonTalk.net was launched.

PART 4: QUESTIONS ABOUT LIST OPERATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How often is the digest sent?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The digest is sent whenever its size reaches 50K, or every 12 hours, if 
the first condition isn't reached.


How do I subscribe/unsubscribe/set digest/unset digest/find out my status?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the interface at http://www.newtontalk.net/


How do I set/unset vacation mode?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send a message from your subscribed address to listar@newtontalk.net with 
the string "set vacation" (without quotes) in the subject line.  You can 
leave the body of the message blank.  To unset, change the word "set" 
above to "unset".


I tried to post this cool file to the list and it didn't show up! What gives?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list software automatically strips away attached files and HTML from 
messages.  Everything is plain text for maximum compatibility with all 
mail software.


I don't want any more spam!!! Remove all of my messages from the archive!
                                    or
Someone said something nasty about me on the list, I demand that you remove it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NewtonTalk is an open, public communications medium.  All posts to the 
list are publically archived in two places:

- On the NTLK website at http://www.newtontalk.net/archive/
- On the searchable MARC archive at http://marc.10east.com/?l=newtontalk

Once a message is posted to the list, it cannot and will not be removed 
from any of the archives.  For one, this would be altering the public 
record of what happened on the list, and we wish to preserve this for as 
long as we can.  Also, MARC will only remove messages if ordered to do so 
by an appropriate court order (threatening e-mails from lawyers will not 
get their attention).
